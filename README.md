# reChord
operating at the intersection of my poor memory, mediocre programming skills, and lack of care for good ui, reChord is a program to help you create and display guitar chord diagrams.

## features
- create guitar chord diagrams
- show said guitar chord diagrams
- save sets of chord diagrams
- load said sets of chord diagrams
- suffer from poor ui

## usage
either download the zip file and run `ReChord.exe` or clone the git repo and run `main.py`. make sure to run it in its own directory. hopefully it works.
