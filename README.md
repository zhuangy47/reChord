# reChord
operating at the intersection of my poor memory, mediocre programming skills, and lack of care for good ui, reChord is a program to help you create and display guitar chord diagrams.

## features
- create guitar chord diagrams
- show said guitar chord diagrams
- save sets of chord diagrams
- load said sets of chord diagrams
- suffer from poor ui

## usage
either download the zip file or clone the git repo and run `main.py`. make sure to run it in its own directory.

to start, create chord diagrams with the 'create' button. add/remove these diagrams to the main canvas with the 'add/remove' button.

for each diagram you create, it creates an svg file. delete with the 'delete' button.

save the current state of the canvas using the 'save' button.

load a save using the 'load' button.
